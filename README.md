# :moneybag: Simple Expense Tracker

This project was made based on Traversy Media's tutorial. Made just for learning purposes.

I changed all the styles and created extras functions by my own.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
